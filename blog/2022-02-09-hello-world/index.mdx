# Hello World
Welcome to my new portfolio website. This website was built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog). <!--truncate--> I chose to build it with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) because of the ease of use, quick development time, and it is pretty feature packed. I plan on using this website for not only a portfolio but a blog and a home for my tutorials.

:::tip You Heard Right!

I plan to use this website as a home for a plethora of tutorials, that I will be creating in the near future. Personally I believe that anyone can become a software engineer.

::: 

If my tutorials help only one person I would consider them successful. I plan to make my tutorials interactive, fun, and up-to-date. There is nothing worse than following a tutorial and nothing works because the tutorial is out of date. 

:::note 

All tutorials will have a list of all software versions used, in the case that a tutorial has not been updated yet.

:::

I will try to keep my tutorials **as interactive as possible** by using some of the tools provided by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog), such as support for [MDXJS](https://mdxjs.com/). 

:::tip Example

Here is an example of how [MDXJS](https://mdxjs.com/) provides great functionality for building interactive tutorials.

```js title="src/example.js"
<button onClick={() => alert('ðŸ˜ƒ')}>Click me!</button>
```

<button class="example-button" onClick={() => alert('See you in the tutorials!')}>Click me!</button>
